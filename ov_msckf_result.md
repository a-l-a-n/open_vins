## 3. Conclusion
1. FEJ gives an significant improvement of precision on both mono and stereo version, while online calibration on intrinsic, extrinsic as well as dt(cam-imu synchronization error) give no obvious improvement, because EuROC provide good calibrations on these information.
2. Precision improved along with sliding window size inreased, while calculation increased too. There is no obviouse improvement on precision when sliding window size beyond 20. We found the best sliding window size on EUROC are 20(mono), 10(stereo).
3. Precision improved along with max slam points inreased, while calculation increased too.
